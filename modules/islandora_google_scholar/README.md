# Islandora Google Scholar

## Introduction

This module maps MODS metadata fields to HTML `<meta>` tags on the fly to help improve indexing in Google Scholar and citation harvesting using citation tools like Zotero.
This module embeds meta tags in the HEAD element for use in indexing.

**Note: Requires MODS 3.1**

Islandora Google Scholar creates meta tags to be placed in the head of the HTML by information stored in the MODS fields. Requires to have at least title, full name of at least one author, and publication year.

Tags are built starting with Citation author. The title is pulled from mods[1] > titleInfo > title
It loops through author names and breaks apart given name and family name.

Google Scholar tags and the MODS values they are extracted from.

| Google Scholar | MODS XPath file                    |
|----------------|------------------------------------|
| journal_title  | relatedItem[@type="host"]/title    |
| volume         | part/detail[@type="volume"]/number |
| issn           | identifier[@type="issn"]           |
| issue          | part/detail[@type="issue"]/number  |
| start_page     | extent[@unit="page"]/start         |
| end_page       | extent[@unit="page"]/end/start     |
| end_page       | extent[@unit="page"]/end/start     |
| online_date    | recordInfo/recordCreationDate      |
| doi            | identifier[@type="doi"]'           |

Google Scholar requires dates in __yy__/__mm__/__dd__ format or just the year. [Link](http://www.loc.gov/standards/datetime/)

| part_date      | date                           |

Defaults to: `//mods:title`

Google Scholar Publication Date SOLR Field<br/>
Defaults to `mods_originInfo_dateIssued_mdt`.<br/>
The solr date field used to facet by publication date during Google Scholar indexing. This is an autocomplete field. Start typing the solr field name and then select from the list. *Be sure to select a field ending with "_dt" or "_mdt", otherwise solr errors will result during google indexing.*

Google Scholar Abstract SOLR Field<br/>
Defaults to `mods_abstract_ms`.
This is used when displaying object abstracts as required by Google Scholar.'

Excluded Content Models<br/>

## Configuring Google Scholar
The islandora_google_scholar module exposes several pages to facilitate Google Scholar indexing of your repository. Urls to these pages should be entered into your [Google Scholar Inclusions dashboard](https://partnerdash.google.com/partnerdash/d/scholarinclusions).

**Year index:** "Please provide the URL of a page listing all years available."
    
    Path: /gs_years, e.g, http://repository.example.edu/gs_years
  
**List of articles for each year:** "Please provide examples of URLs to pages that provide a list of articles for a given year."
       
    Path: /gs_year/[YYYY], e.g. http://repository.example.edu/gs_year/1850

**Abstract examples:** "Please provide examples of individual abstract pages."
    
    Path: /gs_abstract/[PID], e.g. http://repository.example.edu/gs_abstract/samples:1
